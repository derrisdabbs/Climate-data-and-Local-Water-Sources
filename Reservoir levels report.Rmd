# **Impact on Climate Change on Local Water Sources**  

### John Reid, Helene LaVire, Asia Cavazos, Derris Dabbs, and Dustin Smith



## *Abstract*  
    In recent years we have seen a dramatic change in global weather patterns, with increased intensity of storms, constant record
breaking heat indexes, unpredictability, and in some cases extreme cold fronts reaching well below their normal longitudes. With these changes, we have seen increased fears of food and water supply shortages. For example in 2011 - 2012 Lake Meredith (a major supplier of fresh water for the West Texas plains) reached a low less than 100,000 acre-feet, more than 700,000 acre-feet less then its max storage of 800,000 feet. The goal of this study is to analyze time series data to assess the changes in water levels in our local reservoirs, lakes, and aquifers. We will begin by specifically addressing the Edwards aquifer (a major source of water for the "Hill Country" of Texas i.e. Austin, San Antonio, and their surrounding communities). We will look at explanatory variables such as temperature (average highs and lows), humidity, precipitation, population density, water demands, "snow pack" along the watershed's recharge, and other climate activities.
